## Project Overview 

## Why are we doing this project?

To create a sales console application applying my lerning of c# and SQL.

## How I expected the challenge to go 

Slowly as I knew I'd need time to brush up on what we had learnt.

## What went well? 

I'm happy I finished it as I felt I struggled with C# in academy. 

## What did not go as planned? 

I had some issues with matching names and data types across the project. Also folder and file structure was not the easiest to follow
(my fault). 

## Possible improvements for the future 

Better file structure and naming of classes to keep it simple and easy to navigate. 

## Notable Mentions (i.e. anyone that may have helped/produced valuable input to your project)
